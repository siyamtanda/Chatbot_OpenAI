# Chatbot with OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo

This Python script utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model to create a simple chatbot. Users can interact with the chatbot by providing input, and the chatbot responds with generated text based on the GPT-3.5 Turbo model.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI Python library

## Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install openai
Obtain an OpenAI API key from OpenAI and replace "YOUR_API_KEY" in the code with your actual API key.
Usage
Run the script:

python main.py
Enter your messages when prompted with "You:". The chatbot will respond with generated text based on the GPT-3.5 Turbo model.

To exit the chat, type "quit", "exit", or "bye" when prompted.
